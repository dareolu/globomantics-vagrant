- Update Vagrant file - CIDIR for each Data Centre has to be different
- etchosts are not being populated dynamically
- Refactor the code base and remove all occurence of hardcoded values. (Centralize Variables only in group_vars)
- Build a graceful Tear down process of the infrastructure - `Done`
- Make Ansible show the Vagrant Up in verbose
- Make Vagrant Up Idempotent - `Done`
- Develop the single DC version of the infrastructure.(Give a condition in Ansible to accomodate single DC deployment) Currently I have developed {{ dc2 }} and {{ dc1 }} DCs `Done`
- Create a parker repository to build the image. This way we can remove the provisioning of Ansible, Consul, Kubectl and Docker
- Develop Unit tests for every Ansible role
- Update the Vagrant files with CPU/MEmory Variables in group_vars
- Document the code base with descriptive comments
- k8s-Nodes cannot scale more than 9-10 nodes due to how the CIDR is presented. (Need to be more scalable) - Check the Vagrantfile
- Add support for Java version 8 on all the nodes `Done`
- Refactor the code base to support code re-use. Currently the Template files are spread accross each role. We should be able to have them in one central place.
- Document README for each of the roles
- Add support for ELK Stack. Using VMs for ElasticSearch Datanodes, and Kubernetes for Elasticsearch Client and Master nodes
- Rename the k8s-Master so that we can use the same nodes for all Master services. (Not Ideal for Production but okay for Testing/Development). Consul Servers will be used on these nodes as well.
- Configure the disks to be separate from the OS disk
- Configure the Elasticsearch client nodes behind an nginx reverse proxy
- Secure elasticsearch with SSL and shield (look into  xpac.security too)
